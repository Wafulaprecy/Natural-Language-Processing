Natural Language Processing with Python ðŸ“–
Project Overview
This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python, showcasing how text data can be processed, analyzed, and used to perform various NLP tasks. The project demonstrates key NLP techniques, such as text preprocessing, vectorization, and model building, using popular Python libraries.

The main goal of the project is to classify text, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc. This notebook is an excellent introduction to how data science techniques can be applied to raw text data.

Examples of work done in the project include:
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization)
Vectorization techniques (Bag of Words, TF-IDF)
Building classification models on text data
Evaluating the models using various metrics
The project uses libraries like NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, and pandas to perform text processing and machine learning tasks.
